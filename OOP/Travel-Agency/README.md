This project is an application that allows the purchase of travel packages. Since it is a university project, it focuses more on meeting the requirements than on the interactive menu and the application's graphics.

The project meets the following requirements:

➢ Implement at least one vector, set, list, and map from the STL library to manage the application's data.

➢ The application will include a console menu where the user can choose various options (import/export data, read a new object from the keyboard, various application functionalities) in Singleton pattern.

➢ Use at least one Template class (you are not allowed to use the Template class demonstrated in the lab).

➢ Use at least 2 Template methods.

➢ The project must handle all possible exceptions that may occur during code execution (the code must throw at least 6 exceptions, with at least 3 different ones).

➢ Demonstrate the concepts of upcasting and downcasting (dynamic_cast must be used).

➢ Demonstrate the inheritance concept down to the grandchild level (Parent->Child->Grandchild).

➔ Demonstrate HasA and IsA relationships.

➢ Each class must include:

• Default constructor
• Constructor with all parameters
• Copy constructor
• Assignment operator
• Destructor
• Input operator
• Output operator
